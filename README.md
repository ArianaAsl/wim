# backspacevim
This is a Vim configuration that gets you a smilar experience as spacevim but without it acting like a parasite and sitting on top of your existing Vim. Its made on top of the vanilla Vim with the help of plugins and .vimrc configurations. You will never have to run that horrible curl command again!
